Hi there! I am a **first-year Ph.D. student** in the [**Department of Computer Science and Engineering**](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at [**University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) **(UMN)**. I am grateful to be advised by <a href="https://sunju.org/" style="color: #c98f14;font-weight: bold;">Prof. Ju Sun</a>. 

Before enrolling in the Ph.D. program at UMN, I was in the **M.Sc.** program in [**Data Science**](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience) at UMN, I received my **B.Sc.** in [**Applied Mathematics and Statistics**](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ams/) and my **B.A.** in [**Economics**](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/economics/) at [**Stony Brook University**](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). 

My research interests are in **AI for Science, Optimization for AI, and Computer Vision**.

[Let me talk a little bit more ...](#more)
======
Here I also want to introduce a little bit about my **hobbies**, you can skip this part if not interested <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-squint-tears"></i>: 

Before entering my current research field, I was mostly interested in **computer graphics** and **game programming** <i class="fa-solid fa-gamepad"></i>. So previously, I was thinking about starting a game studio with <span style='color: #c98f14'>**Haoyu**</span>. We named it <span style="color:#7a0019">**Guinea Pig Farmers**</span> and the logo <img src="/images/GPF.jpg"  style=" height: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle;"> was originally designed for that studio. We postponed this idea because none of us is good at painting or arts and right now we both started our Ph.D. degrees. So it looks like this idea will not be realized in the short term <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-squint-tears"></i>. Showing here is a demo of our previous [**snow globe**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmqCdvWFfCk) project built on SPH water simulation.

Another thing that is important for me is **piano** <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i>. I have been playing the piano since I was 4 and have earned numerous certificates for amateur players in China. During my undergraduate time, I also provided introductory piano lessons for several students. My favorite artist is <span style='color: #c98f14'>**Animenz**</span> and I usually listen to his piano covers while doing the research. You can check [**his Youtube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@Animenzzz) if you are interested. Right now I am picking up his cover of [**Kaibutsu**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD3MlqaLDZM) and [**Ninelie**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWNbcxXDmt0). One of my goal is to place a [**Steinway & Sons 9' Concert Grand Piano**](https://eu.steinway.com/en/pianos/steinway-grand-pianos/d-274/) at home <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-squint-tears"></i>.
